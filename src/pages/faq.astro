              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-yellow mb-3">What is stump grinding and how does it work?</h3>
              <div class="text-gray-300 space-y-3">
                <p>Stump grinding is the process of using a specialized machine to grind a tree stump down below the surface of the ground — typically 6–12 inches deep. This depth allows new grass, plants, or landscaping to grow naturally over the area.</p>
                <p>Our grinder uses a heavy‑duty rotating cutting wheel that chips the stump into mulch as it works. The process is fast, clean, and far less disruptive than full stump removal, which requires digging out the entire root system. With grinding, the deeper roots are left in place to decompose naturally over time, and the mulch created during the process can either be left on site or hauled away based on your preference.</p>
                <p>For most Jacksonville homeowners, stump grinding is the most efficient, affordable, and landscape‑friendly solution.</p>
              </div>

            <!-- Question 2 -->

              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-yellow mb-3">How much does stump grinding cost in Jacksonville, FL?</h3>
              <div class="text-gray-300 space-y-3">
                <p>Pricing depends on several factors, including:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-4">
                  <li>The size and diameter of the stump</li>
                  <li>The type of wood</li>
                  <li>The number of stumps</li>
                  <li>How accessible the area is</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every project includes a minimum setup cost to cover essentials like insurance, fuel, transportation, and equipment setup. From there, pricing is calculated using either a cost‑per‑inch (based on stump diameter) or cost‑per‑square‑foot (based on the total grinding area).</p>
                <p>Because every property is different, there's no universal one‑price‑fits‑all option — but we stay very aware of DIY rental costs and competitor pricing to ensure our rates remain extremely competitive.</p>
                <p>For most residential projects involving 1–3 small to medium‑sized stumps, a reasonable planning budget is $200–$400.</p>
                <p>We serve all of Duval, St. Johns, Clay, and Nassau Counties and provide competitive pricing for both residential and commercial clients.</p>
                <p>You can get a free same‑day estimate by calling <a href="tel:9044082450" class="text-brand-yellow hover:text-yellow-400 font-semibold">904‑408‑2450</a> and providing the stump diameter, quantity, and location.</p>

                  </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Most Jacksonville homeowners choose stump grinding because it's efficient, cost‑effective, and far less damaging to the surrounding landscape.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <div class="bg-black border-l-4 border-brand-yellow p-6 rounded-r-lg">
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-yellow mb-3">Is there a size limit for the stumps you can grind?</h3>
              <div class="text-gray-300">
                <p>No — we can handle any size stump, from small shrubs to massive pines and live oaks. Our professional‑grade equipment is built to take on the large hardwood stumps commonly found throughout Northeast Florida.</p>
                <p>If your stump is in a tight area, we simply need 36 inches of gate width to access most backyards.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 5 -->
            <div class="bg-black border-l-4 border-brand-yellow p-6 rounded-r-lg">
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-yellow mb-3">Do you grind surface roots too?</h3>
              <div class="text-gray-300">
                <p>Yes — we offer root chasing, which allows us to grind down exposed or raised surface roots that may be creating tripping hazards, damaging lawn equipment, or interfering with landscaping.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 6 -->
            <div class="bg-black border-l-4 border-brand-yellow p-6 rounded-r-lg">
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-yellow mb-3">What happens to the wood chips after grinding?</h3>
              <div class="text-gray-300">
                <p>You decide. We can:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-4">
                  <li>Leave the mulch on site (great for flower beds, natural areas, or erosion control)</li>
                  <li>Haul everything away for a clean, finished look</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most homeowners choose to keep the mulch, but if you prefer a completely cleared area, we're happy to remove it.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 7 -->
            <div class="bg-black border-l-4 border-brand-yellow p-6 rounded-r-lg">
              <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-yellow mb-3">Will stump grinding damage my yard?</h3>
              <div class="text-gray-300 space-y-3">
                <p>We take a safety‑first, property‑first approach on every job.</p>
                <p>Before we begin, we'll review access routes, utilities, and any landscaping concerns. While the immediate area around the stump will be disturbed, we work carefully to protect your lawn, hardscaping, and surrounding plants. We also set up a protective barricade to reduce the risk of flying debris while the grinder is in use.</p>
                <p>Our goal is simple: turn your stump into a tidy pile of mulch with as little impact to your yard as possible. The mulch left behind can even improve soil health as it naturally breaks down.</p>
